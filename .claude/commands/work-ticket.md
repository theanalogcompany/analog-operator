description: Run the autonomous ticket workflow on a Linear ticket. Plan-first, build only on explicit approval.
---

You are working on Linear ticket $ARGUMENTS for analog-operator. Each invocation is idempotent: it reads the ticket's state from Linear (and git), determines what to do, runs that work, and either exits cleanly or schedules the next invocation via `ScheduleWakeup` where a harness is available. Never instruct the operator to type `/loop`.

# State detection (run first on every invocation)

1. **Re-read ticket state.** `Linear:get_issue` for body + status, `Linear:list_comments` for the full comment thread (createdAt order). In CI there is no Linear MCP — use the GraphQL API with curl and `$LINEAR_API_KEY`.

2. **Compute.** Marker-detection convention: "body contains `[MARKER]`" means `body.includes('[MARKER]')` — substring match, NOT `startsWith`. Bot comments always begin with the `**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**` prefix, so markers never sit at byte 0. Use `includes` uniformly across `[POLLING-STATE]`, `[POLLING-ACK]`, `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]`, `[POLLING-CLOSED]`, `[NEEDS-INPUT]`, `[NEEDS-ACTION]`, `[PLAN]`, `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]`.

   **Provenance comes from the prefix, never from the author ID.** Every comment on every ticket is under Jaipal's account, your own included.

   - `botComments` — comments whose body contains `**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**`
   - `humanComments` — every other comment. A comment with no recognised prefix is human input.
   - `lastBotComment` — most recent of `botComments` (null if none). **Used for `parentId` threading and terminal-state detection only.**
   - `lastQuestionComment` — most recent bot comment whose body does NOT contain any of `[POLLING-STATE]`, `[POLLING-ACK]`, `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]`, `[POLLING-CLOSED]` (null if none). **Used for routing decisions and as the `newReplies` baseline.**
   - `newReplies` — human comments created after `(lastQuestionComment?.createdAt ?? '0')`
   - `pollingState` — most recent bot comment containing `[POLLING-STATE]`
   - `branchExists` — `git branch --list jaipal/TAC-XXX-*` non-empty

3. **Stale-session check.** Capture `invocationStartedAt` BEFORE the comment read. If `pollingState` exists AND `pollingState.updatedAt > invocationStartedAt`, another chain is active for this ticket — exit immediately, no further action, no new ScheduleWakeup.

4. **Branch table.** Terminal-state checks read `lastBotComment`. All other rows read `lastQuestionComment`.

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `lastBotComment` contains `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]` and no human reply postdates it | Exit. No wakeup. |
| `lastBotComment` contains `[NEEDS-ACTION]` and no human reply postdates it | Exit. Blocked on Jaipal executing something. |
| `lastBotComment` contains `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]` and no human reply postdates it | Exit. No wakeup. |
| `lastBotComment` contains `[POLLING-CLOSED]` | Exit. No wakeup. Operator-driven wind-down. |
| `lastBotComment` contains a PR link (Phase 5 marker) | Exit. No wakeup. Manual merge gate. |
| `botComments.length === 0` | Fresh run. Phase 0 → Phase 2. |
| `lastQuestionComment` exists, `newReplies.length === 0`, harness available, `pollingState.iteration < 26` | Run Phase 0. Increment iteration, update `[POLLING-STATE]`, ScheduleWakeup per backoff, exit. |
| `lastQuestionComment` exists, `newReplies.length === 0`, no harness | Exit. The ticket is in Needs Ruling; the 15-minute poll resumes it when Jaipal replies. |
| `lastQuestionComment` exists, `newReplies.length === 0`, `pollingState.iteration >= 26` | Post `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]`. Exit. Leave the ticket in Needs Ruling. |
| `lastQuestionComment` exists, `newReplies.length > 0` | Run Phase 0. Classify the most recent reply (see "Reply classification"). Route accordingly. |

# Reply classification (3-way)

Take the most recent human reply and classify it:

1. **Proceed** — approves the plan or answers the question with a clear go signal ("build", "approved, proceed", or a direct answer that unblocks). Route per "Phase resumption".
2. **Modify** — carries revisions or new constraints ("looks good but change X"). Integrate, re-post the plan prefixed `[PLAN]`, leave the ticket in Needs Ruling, exit.
3. **Wind-down** — says stop without proceeding ("this works, close it", "no further scope"). Post `[POLLING-CLOSED]`, exit. Status untouched; Jaipal closes manually.

Chit-chat or holding-pattern ("let me think", "be back in an hour") is NOT substantive — post `[POLLING-ACK]`, leave the ticket where it is, exit.

When intent is ambiguous between Proceed/Modify and Wind-down, default to Proceed/Modify. A false wind-down terminates the chain; a false negative is recoverable.

# Phase resumption

When the classification is **Proceed**, route by `lastQuestionComment`:

- **`[PLAN]`** → approval received. Advance to Phase 3.
- **`[NEEDS-INPUT]` AND `branchExists === false`** → Phase 2 question answered. Re-run Phase 1 audit integrating the answer, re-post the plan, return to Needs Ruling.
- **`[NEEDS-INPUT]` AND `branchExists === true`** → Phase 3 question answered. Read `git status` and `git diff` on the branch to establish what is done and what is left, then continue.

On resuming from a ruling, remove the answered item from the ticket body's `## Open questions` block, and remove the `Needs Decision` label. Then move the ticket to where it left: **In Progress** if a branch exists, **Ready** if none does. Never move a ticket to Todo — Todo means unaudited, and this ticket has been audited and ruled on.

# Phase 0 — Verify scope (runs every invocation)
1. Re-read the ticket body and status — surfaces mid-flow edits.
2. **Status and open-questions gate.** This ticket must be in **Ready** or **In Progress**. A ticket in **Todo** has not been audited yet — say so and exit; the audit automation reaches it within fifteen minutes. If `## Open questions` has any content, it is not buildable whatever its status: move it to Needs Ruling, add `Needs Decision`, post a short comment naming the unanswered items, and exit. Do not plan. Do not branch.
3. Re-read the relevant sections of CLAUDE.md — Workflow rules, Code conventions, Common gotchas. Cite which sections you consulted on the FIRST invocation.
4. Check the "Notes for Claude Code" block. If high-stakes (auth — Supabase session, JWT handling, deep link callbacks; any API call that sends a message via the analog-guest API — operator approve/edit/skip/undo, which reaches Sendblue downstream; writes to Expo SecureStore; push notification entitlements or APNs configuration), STOP. Post `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]` summarizing what you would be touching and the risks. Set status to Needs Ruling with `Needs Decision`. Exit.

# Phase 1 — Audit (read-only) — fresh start or post-`[NEEDS-INPUT]` Phase 2 resumption
5. Use the Explore subagent to map the affected surface area. Read at least one existing file the new code will sit next to. Read migrations touching relevant tables. Read existing tests for modules being modified.
6. Identify existing utilities to reuse. Check `lib/`, `components/`, `hooks/`. Grep for any new function name you would add to confirm it does not already exist.
7. **Cross-repo audit.** If the ticket has a `## Contract` section, OR references a sibling ticket in `analog-guest`, fetch and read the sibling ticket AND the Contract before writing the plan. The plan MUST cite the Contract verbatim where it touches contract surface — endpoint path, request shape, response shape, env var names and formats. A needed deviation is a Phase 2 open question, not a Phase 3 silent fix. See CLAUDE.md "Cross-repo contracts".

# Phase 2 — Plan
8. Output a written plan: scope, file paths, function decomposition, sequence, patterns reused, edge cases, what you chose NOT to do, open questions.
9. If the Testing section is blank or partial, propose automated coverage. Match the qa-runner subagent's categorization rules.
10. If `## Gate` names no QA route, propose one — `QA: Script` if provable by a test or query, `QA: Device` if it needs Jaipal on a real device or at the venue. Operator tickets skew device-heavy; say so plainly rather than proposing a script route that cannot exist.
11. If the plan has open questions:
    - Post `[NEEDS-INPUT]` with questions numbered and options stated. State the options; do not recommend one.
    - Add the same numbered questions to the ticket body's `## Open questions` block.
    - Set status to **Needs Ruling** with `Needs Decision`.
    - Where a harness exists, write `[POLLING-STATE]` (iteration=1) and ScheduleWakeup(60s). In CI, exit.
12. If the plan is clear:
    - Post it prefixed `[PLAN]`, threaded via `parentId` if a prior bot comment exists.
    - Set status to **Needs Ruling** with `Needs Decision`. A plan awaiting approval is a decision Jaipal owes, and it belongs where he looks.
    - Where a harness exists, write `[POLLING-STATE]` (iteration=1) and ScheduleWakeup(60s) so a fast reply is caught. In CI, exit; the poll resumes it.

Advance to Phase 3 only on a substantive approval reply. A reply with revisions counts as substantive — integrate, re-post, return to Needs Ruling.

# Standing rulings

Pre-authorized. Decide and proceed, naming the ruling in your comment so a pre-authorized decision is distinguishable from a silent one.

- **SR-1 Contrast and accessibility figures.** WCAG arithmetic, not taste.
- **SR-2 Copy that is factually wrong about system behaviour.** Correct it. Does not extend to copy in the agent's voice.
- **SR-3 Test quality.** Mutation verification, real gate vs mock, assertion targets.

Everything else is Jaipal's: anything in the agent's voice a guest can read, anything that changes what auto-sends or when, anything where the answer is taste. SR-2 does not cover operator-app copy describing what a send will do — that is one edit from the guest-facing surface and stays with Jaipal.

# Phase 3 — Build (only after explicit substantive approval)
13. **Sync local `main` before branching.** Skip if the branch exists. Otherwise `git checkout main && git fetch origin && git pull origin main --ff-only`. If `--ff-only` fails — local `main` diverged — STOP. Post `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]` with `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main` and `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`, set Needs Ruling with `Needs Decision`, exit. Do NOT auto-rebase or reset. (Branching from stale local `main` produced the TAC-37 conflict storm.)
14. Create the branch if absent: `jaipal/TAC-XXX-short-description`.
15. Implement the plan. Match existing patterns. `@/*` alias for imports. Errors as values: `{ ok: true, data }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. Throw only at outer boundaries. Zod at boundaries. No `any`. No new top-level directories without asking.
16. If a question surfaces mid-build, post `[NEEDS-INPUT]`, add it to `## Open questions`, set Needs Ruling with `Needs Decision`, exit. Don't guess. If it blocks only one item of a multi-item ticket, ship the unblocked items and split the blocked item into its own ticket in Needs Ruling.
17. **If something requires Jaipal to execute it** — a production migration, an env var, an Expo or APNs console change, a build or submit step, anything on a physical device — post `[NEEDS-ACTION]`, set Needs Ruling with `Needs Action`, exit. The comment must contain, and nothing may substitute for:
    1. The exact command or SQL in a code block, runnable as-is. No placeholders.
    2. Where it runs — which database, environment, shell, device.
    3. The rollback in its own code block, runnable as-is. If you cannot write one, say so explicitly rather than omitting it.
    4. One line: what should be true afterward, checkable in one query or one glance.

    When Jaipal confirms it ran, verify against the live system — live schema inspection, a real API response, the actual build manifest — not against the migration file and not against his confirmation.
18. **If you find a defect outside this ticket's scope**, post `[FINDING]`. Do not file a ticket, do not fix it, do not widen scope. Maximum three per ticket; list any remainder as one-liners under "not detailed".
19. **CLAUDE.md hygiene check.** Before exiting Build, evaluate whether this change introduces anything belonging in CLAUDE.md per "Keeping this file current": new `package.json` scripts, new migrations (with log entry), new library patterns, gotchas found during implementation, new directories, new env vars, new workflow rules, version bumps to documented dependencies. If yes, update CLAUDE.md in the same commit. If no, note in the PR description: *"CLAUDE.md update considered: [what you checked, why no update needed]."* Without that line by Phase 5, the task is incomplete.

# Phase 4 — Verify
20. `npx tsc --noEmit` — must pass.
21. `npm run lint` — must pass.
22. Test gate (conditional on `package.json`):
    - No `package.json`, or no `"test"` script: emit `tests: not yet configured — jest-expo wired during TAC-112 Phase 1 scaffold` and continue. Non-blocker.
    - Has a `"test"` script: run `npm test`. All must pass. Report count delta vs main. Any failure blocks.
23. If the diff touches any screen under `app/**` or any component under `components/**`, invoke the `qa-runner` subagent.
24. Invoke `code-reviewer` on the diff. Address BLOCKER and MAJOR; explain skips on MINOR.

# Phase 5 — Ship
25. Commit. Subject: `TAC-XXX: <imperative lowercase subject>`. Body explains why if non-obvious.
26. `gh pr create`. Title matches the commit subject. Body: changes + test count delta + plan deviations + the CLAUDE.md note + anything you would push back on.
27. Post a Linear comment with the PR link. Apply the QA route label (`QA: Script` or `QA: Device`) if not already set. **Do not set the status to Ready For QA by hand** — opening the PR moves the ticket to In Review automatically, and merging moves it to Ready For QA automatically.
28. Set the ticket to **Needs Ruling** with the `Needs Action` label: the merge is Jaipal's to run. Then exit. He runs `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` after reviewing the PR on GitHub, and the merge automation moves the ticket to Ready For QA.

**Cross-repo UAT gate.** If Phase 1 flagged a sibling ticket, the PR description MUST call out: *"Cross-repo UAT REQUIRED before Done — unit tests passing on both sides does not prove the contract is consistent."* The ticket stays in Ready For QA until Jaipal runs UAT against the deployed sibling client. The 2026-05-27 TAC-207 incident (both sides green, integration broken 9 hours after deploy) is the documented case.

# Polling protocol

Where a harness is available, ScheduleWakeup the next invocation after posting a comment that requires a human response. Exceptions that exit immediately: `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]`, `[NEEDS-ACTION]`, `[POLLING-CLOSED]`, `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]`, and PR-link comments.

**In CI there is no harness.** Do not attempt ScheduleWakeup. Move the ticket to Needs Ruling and exit; the 15-minute poll is the resume mechanism.

`[NEEDS-ACTION]` never polls even with a harness. The blocking step is Jaipal at a laptop or holding a device, not answering from his phone.

## Backoff

Intervals (seconds): 60, 120, 240, 300, 300, ... cap at 300. `TIMEOUT_LIMIT = 26` iterations, ≈ 2 hours. At the limit, post `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]` and exit, leaving the ticket in Needs Ruling.

## `[POLLING-STATE]` comment (single, edited in place)

One per session. Capture its id from the create response; later updates edit that comment.

```
**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**

[POLLING-STATE] iteration=N nextWakeupAt=<ISO timestamp> sessionStartedAt=<ISO timestamp>
```

Reset iteration to 1 whenever any reply lands. Its `updatedAt` is also the staleness signal.

## `[POLLING-ACK]` comment

Threaded under the operator's holding-pattern reply, not under `lastBotComment`:

```
**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**

[POLLING-ACK] Got it — still polling for your answer.
```

Then update `[POLLING-STATE]` (iteration 1) and ScheduleWakeup(60s).

## `[POLLING-TIMEOUT]` comment

```
**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**

[POLLING-TIMEOUT] Exhausted automated polling after 2 hours. Reply when ready — the poll will pick this back up.
```

## `[POLLING-CLOSED]` comment

Threaded under the operator's wind-down reply:

```
**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**

[POLLING-CLOSED] Acknowledged — exiting per operator's wind-down reply.
```

Status untouched. The agent never sets a ticket to Done; the permission hook denies it.

## Comment threading

Default `parentId = lastBotComment.id`. Exception: `[POLLING-CLOSED]` and `[POLLING-ACK]` thread under the operator's triggering reply. Polling logic does not depend on `parentId`, so threading failures are cosmetic — log and continue.

# Hard rules (non-negotiable)
- Plan gate (Phase 2 → 3) requires explicit substantive approval. Do not advance on silence or on chit-chat. The substantive-answer judgment IS the gate.
- **Provenance is the prefix, never the author ID.** Every comment shares one author. A comment with no `**[FROM CLAUDE CODE]**` prefix is human input.
- ScheduleWakeup is the only polling primitive where a harness exists — no `Bash sleep`, no until-loops. In CI, don't poll at all.
- No auto-merge. The merge gate stays manual.
- **Build only from Ready or In Progress.** Todo means committed but not yet audited.
- **Never promote a ticket to Ready.** Only an audit that found nothing, or a ruling from Jaipal, puts a ticket there. Never move anything to Todo at all.
- **Anything that needs Jaipal moves the ticket to Needs Ruling immediately**, with the right `Blocked On` label. Never wait silently on a ticket whose status still claims it is available. A plan awaiting approval counts.
- **Never run a production migration.** Write the SQL and hand it over via `[NEEDS-ACTION]`.
- No loyalty-program language anywhere — points, rewards, tier, earn, badges, progress bars are forbidden. Guests are recognized, not enrolled.
- High-stakes uncertainty → `[HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED]`, never `[NEEDS-INPUT]`.
- Wind-down is operator-driven. The agent never decides to wind down on its own.
- The agent never marks a ticket Done. In Review and Ready For QA are set by Linear's PR automations, not by you.
- CLAUDE.md hygiene is mandatory in every Build phase. Skipping = drift, drift = future pain.
- **Cross-repo tickets cannot move to Done on unit-test pass alone.** Unit tests prove each side is internally consistent with its own assumption of the contract; they do not prove the assumptions match. Manual end-to-end UAT is mandatory before Done, and is NOT deferred to the sibling ticket. See CLAUDE.md "Cross-repo contracts."
